.SH DESCRIPTION
These commands provide a flexible query interface to the
.I id
database.
.I Lid\^
does a lookup on
.IR patters
and prints out lines in this way:
.PP
.nf
idname        ../hdir/hfile.h ../cdir/{cfile1,cfile2}.c
.fi
.PP
Notice that multiple files with the same directory prefix
and suffix are concatenated in the globbing-set-notation of
.IR csh (1).
Also notice that all of the
.I id
database query commands adjust the list of pathnames to be relative
to your current working directory, provided that
.IR mkid (1)
was used to build the database, and your working directory
is located within the sub-tree covered by the
.I id
database.
.PP
If multiple names match on pattern, then there will be one line
of output per name.  The mnemonic significance of the name is
\fI\|l(ookup) id\fP.
.PP
.I Gid
does a lookup and then searches for the names it matches in the
files where they occur.  The mnemonic for this name is
\fI\|g(rep)id\fP. 
.PP
.I Eid
does a lookup, and then invokes an editor on all files with
the matched name as an initial search string.  Of course, this
name stands for
\fI\|e(dit) id\fP.
.PP
.I Eid
uses four environment variables to control its invocation of the
editor.
Naturally,
.B EDITOR
is used to locate the editing program.
.B EIDARG
is a
.IR printf (3S)
string used to specify the form of the initial-search-string
argument.  If the editor does not support such an argument,
this variable may be left unset.
.B EIDLDEL
and
.B EIDRDEL
specify the form of the left and right word-delimiters respectively.
The best way to explain the use of these last three variables is
with an example.  Here are the proper settings for vi(1):
.nf
EIDARG='+/%s/'	# initial search argument template
EIDLDEL='\\<'	# left word-delimiter
EIDRDEL='\\>'	# right word-delimiter
.fi
.PP
.I Patterns
may be simple alpha-numeric strings, or regular expressions in the
style of
.IR regcmp (3).
If the string contains no regular-expression meta-characters, it is
searched for as a
.IR word .
If the string contains meta-characters, or if the \-e argument is
supplied, it is searched for as regular-expression.
.PP
.I Aid\^
produces output in the style of
.I lid\^
but its pattern arguments are searched for as substrings within
the identifiers in the database.  No regular-expression search
is performed, even if the pattern contains meta-characters.
The search is conducted in an alphabetic case insensitive manner.
The mnemonic for this name is
\fI\|a(propos) id\fP. 
.PP
.I Pid\^
is used to match the input patterns against the names of the files
in the database rather than the contents of the files. The pattern
is assumed to be a simple shell wild card pattern unless the
.B \-e
option is given, in which case full regular expression matching
is used.
The
.B \-b
option can be used to restrict the match to just the basename portion
of the full absolute path name of the file.
The mnemonic for this name is
\fI\|p(ath) id\fP. 
.PP
The following options are recognized:
.TP 10
.BR \-f file\^
Use
.I file\^
as the database instead of the default
.BR ID .
.TP 10
.BR \-u n
Lists all identifiers in the database that are non-unique within the first
.I n
characters.  This facility is particularly helpful when porting a program
to a system whose compiler or linker has fewer significant characters
for identifiers.
.TP 10
.BR \-r dir\^
Assume the names stored in the database are relative to this directory.
This option is useful if you create the database in one place, then move
it somewhere else. Normally all the query tools assume the names in
the database are relative to the location of the database.
.TP 10
.B \-c
This option is similar to
.BR \-r ,
but it tells the id query tool to assume the names in the ID database
are stored relative to the current working directory.
.TP 10
.B \-k
Suppresses the use of \fL{\fP and \fL}\fP as a shorthand in the
generated list of file names. Each name is output in full.
.TP 10
.B \-n
Suppresses printing the name of the search string, only the names of
the files containing the string are printed. Together with the \fB\-k\fP
option this can be used to generate lists of files to pass to other
programs.
.PP
.TP 10
.B \-b
In the
.I pid
program, the
.B \-b
option is used to force pattern matching on just the base names of the
file, otherwise the pattern matching is done on the full absolute file
name.
.PP
The remaining options are for use in conjunction with numeric patterns:
.TP 10
.B \-doxa
These options may be specified in any combination.
They limit numeric matches to specific radixes.
The
.BR \-d ,
.BR \-o ,
and
.B \-x
options limit matches to decimal, octal, and hexadecimal respectively.
The
.BR \-a
option is a shorthand for specifying all three radixes.
.PP
Searches for numbers 
are conducted numerically rather than lexically, so that all
representations for a given number are potentially available
from a single search.
.TP 10
.B \-m
Merge multiple lines of output into a single line.
.TP 10
.B \-s
Limit the results of the search to identifiers that occur only
once in the entire set of sources covered by the database.
This option is useful for finding identifiers that are defined
but never used.
