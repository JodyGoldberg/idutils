`mkid' TODO - Future directions

* Bring all code into conformance with GNU project coding standards.
  - Use command-line arguments, not the name of the program in argv[0]
    to determine lid's behavior
  - Revise the command-line argument syntax, in particular the mkid
    scanner-arg syntax.
  - Use getopt_long () in all programs to parse command-line arguments
  - Handle GNU standard arguments: In particular, --version & --help

* Portability
  - The configure script tests for lots of things, but the code doesn't
    use all of the results that it should.
  - Fix filenames.c to handle non-UNIX file names properly
    (notably DOS & OS/2).
  - Fix assumption that (sizeof (int) == sizeof (long))

* all query interfaces
  - add environment variable for setting default ID file name.

* lid
  - change the name of the program to something a bit more
    descriptive, e.g., "findid".
  - use "long long" (if the compiler supports it) integer comparisons
    in find_number().
  - generalize the command-line interface for different behaviors.
    User passes a command-format string for operating on the results
    of a query:
    %t = token, %f = crunched file list, %F = uncrunched file list
    Recommend the following aliases to emulate old behavior:
      alias lid="findid -e 'echo %t %f'"
      alias eid="findid -e 'vi +/\\<%t\\>/ %F'" # for vi users
      alias gid="findid -e 'egrep \\<%t\\> %F'"

* mkid & lid
  - store & retrieve floating point literals
  - automatically crack (optionally gzipped or compressed) tar files, so
    you can index and search archived source without having to unpack it.

* mkid
  - add a recursive file tree walker, so a complete list of file names
    need not be supplied.
  - (Optinally?) store tokenized contents of comments.
  - Store attributes with symbols: type, func, variable struct-tag
    enum-tag, keyword, etc.  Store caller/callee relationships between
    identifiers.  Indicate which files have defns vs. uses.  This info
    is needed to support a cscope interface.
  - Add times(2) results to statistics output.
  - treat \ specially for TeX files and do likewise with @ for Texinfo.

* cscope
  - add a cscope work-alike query interface (this is being done by
    Maureen Lecuona <lecuona@paul.rutgers.edu>)

* grep
  - Hack GNU grep to use a mkid database for hints about which files to
    search.
