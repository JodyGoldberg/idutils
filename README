`mkid' is a simple, fast, high-capacity, language-independent
identifier database tool.  Actually, the term `identifier' is too
limiting--`mkid' stores tokens, be they program identifiers of any
form, literal numbers, or words of human-readable text.

`mkid' was originally written by Greg McGary <gkm@magilla.cichlid.com>
and posted to comp.sources.unix in September 1987.  It was then
maintained and enhanced by a loose knit group of programmers on the
Internet led by Tom Horsley <Tom.Horsley@mail.hcsc.com>.  Tom released
`mkid2' on comp.sources.unix in February 1991.  Since then, Greg
McGary has resumed maintenance and is working on a greatly enhanced
version 3 under GPL.

Send bug reports to <gkm@magilla.cichlid.com>.  A bug report is an
adequate description of the problem: your input, what you expected,
what you got, and why this is wrong.  Diffs are welcome, but they only
describe a solution, from which the problem might be uneasy to infer.
