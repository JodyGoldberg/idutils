`mkid' README.alpha-test

Special instructions for alpha testers:

* The code is pretty solid, so I expect most problems to be portability
  issues.

* At least do this:

	./configure --prefix test; make all; make check; make install.

  Make check should "echo OK" if it succeeded.  This is not a very rigorous
  test, but it at least ensures sanity for the core tools.
  If all goes well and you want to start using it, reconfigure to install
  in a normal place, e.g.,

	 # put things in /usr/local/{bin,lib,info} (the default)
	./configure; make install
		-or-
	 # put things in /usr/{bin,lib,info}
	./configure --prefix /usr; make install

  If you have the time, patience and software, please build using both your
  vendor-supplied compiler and gcc.  By default, configure will use gcc if
  it is available.  You can override this by doing this:

	make distclean
	CC=vendor-supplied-cc ./configure	# bourne-shell syntax
		-or-
	setenv CC vendor-supplied-cc; ./configure # csh syntax


* If you run into build problems, please help by emailing me the following:
  * A brilliant, elegant patch to fix it. ;-)
  -- or, if you don't have time for that... --
  * The version of mkid you're trying to build
    (type ./mkid to get the usage banner which includes the version)
  * The output of "make -k all", to show me where it's dying.
  * The output of "uname -a"
  * The output of "nm" on your system's libc.
  * An ID file of the .h files in your system's /usr/include (I know--it's
    a checken and egg problem.  Use mkid2.  You don't have mkid2?  It's ok,
    don't knock yourself out.)

* Be aware that this is still work in progress.  See TODO for a list of
  things yet undone.

* Note that ID file format is incompatible with mkid2, so you'll have to
  rebuild your ID files.  You should notice that the new mkid is faster.
