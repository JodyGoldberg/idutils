`mkid' THANKS file

mkid, lid, fid, and idx were originally written by Greg McGary.  iid
and pid were written by Tom Horsley, who also maintained the programs
for a time and released mkid2 to comp.sources.unix.  mkid.texinfo was
written by Tom Horsley.

Special thanks go to Francois Pinard worked tirelessly to refine
mkid's autoconfiscation, ensure mkid's conformance to GNU standards,
and generally pick all the nits that were fit to pick. ;-)

Many people further contributed to mkid by reporting problems,
suggesting improvements, or submitting patches.  Here is a list of
these people.  If you contributed, but don't see your name here,
please notify me (Greg McGary) at the address in the README file.
Help keep this list complete and accurate.
