`mkid' README.alpha-test

Special instructions for testers:

* The file-tree walking code is new.  It passes purify tests, and seems to
  work pretty well.  So far, I've only compiled and built on Linux
  (libc-5.2.4), SunOS 4.1.4 and BSDI 2.0.1.  I expect some portability
  problems on other systems.

* At least do this:

	./configure --prefix=test; make all; make check; make install.

  This is not a very rigorous test, but it at least ensures sanity for the
  core tools.  If all goes well and you want to start using it, reconfigure
  to install in a normal place, e.g.,

	 # put things in /usr/local/{bin,lib,info} (the default)
	./configure; make install
		-or-
	 # put things in /usr/{bin,lib,info}
	./configure --prefix=/usr; make install

  If you have the time, patience and software, please build using both your
  vendor-supplied *ANSI* C compiler and gcc.  (non-ANSI compilation is
  broken for now...) By default, configure will use gcc if it is available.
  You can override this by doing this:

	make distclean
	CC=vendor-supplied-cc ./configure	# bourne-shell syntax
		-or-
	setenv CC vendor-supplied-cc; ./configure # csh syntax


* If you run into build problems, please help by emailing me the following:
  * A brilliant, elegant patch to fix it. ;-)
  -- or, if you don't have time for that... --
  * The version of mkid you're trying to build
    (type ./mkid to get the usage banner which includes the version)
  * The output of "make -k all", to show me where it's dying.
  * The output of "uname -a"
  * The output of "nm" on your system's libc, if applicable.

* Be aware that this is still work in progress.  See TODO for a list of
  things yet undone.

* Note that ID file format is incompatible with all previous versions of
  mkid, so you'll have to rebuild your ID files.
