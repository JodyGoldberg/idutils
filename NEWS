id-utils NEWS - User visible changes.

Version 3.0.9 - May 1996, by Greg McGary

* The package name has been changed from `mkid' to `id-utils', and is now
  officially a part of GNU.

* Command-line arguments have been revised to conform with GNU standards.
  Each command now processes --help and --version long arguments.

* The texinfo manual is out-of-date.  Please use the `--help' option for
  correct information about command-line arguments.  I'll work on updating
  it tonight.

* `mkid' and `idx' use a file-tree walker.  Give them one or more directory
  names on the command-line, and they'll recursively descend looking for
  source files.  lib/language.map (installe as $(prefix)/share/language.map)
  contains patterns for mapping file names to the appropriate language scanner.

* id-utils now uses automake.

* gid, aid and eid are now shell-script wrappers that
  call `lid' with the apropriate argument.

* A new environment `IDPATH' contains a colon-separated list of ID ID file
  names for use by `fid' and `lid'.  It is only partially implemented at
  this time only the first ID file is actually handled, the rest are
  ignored.

* pid is temporarily gone, but will reappear soon.

* iid has been removed from the distribution.

* Support for non-ANSI compilers is broken.  Don't expect it to work.
  If you use gcc, all will be well.

* Miscellaneous bugs are fixed.

Version 3.0 - February 1995, by Greg McGary

* `mkid' uses a new efficient algorithm for building the database.  The old
  algorithm was O(n^2) for space and would exhaust memory or lead to page
  thrashing on very large programs.  The new algorithm is linear with the
  size of the input for both time and space.  It is now possible to build
  very large `mkid' databases covering many thousands of files totalling
  tens of megabytes and containing hundreds of thousands of unique tokens.

* The database header is now byte-order and word-size independent.  ID
  files may be shared across networks of dissimilar architectures.
