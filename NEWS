Version 3.0 - February 1995, by Greg McGary

* mkid uses a new efficient algorithm for building the database.  The old
algorithm was O(n^2) for space and would exhaust memory or lead to page
thrashing on very large programs.  The new algorithm is linear with the
size of the input for both time and space.  It is now possible to build
very large mkid databases covering many thousands of files totalling tens
of megabytes and containing hundreds of thousands of unique tokens.

* The database header is now byte-order and word-size independent.  ID
files may be shared across networks of dissimilar architectures.
